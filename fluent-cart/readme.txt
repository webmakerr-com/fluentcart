== eCommerce for Developers ==
FluentCart was built by developers who understand the pain of working with rigid eCommerce systems. Its architecture is entirely action and filter-driven, letting you override, extend, or customize anything without hacks or fragile workarounds.

All data is stored in dedicated database tables for performance and portability. We’ve optimized the queries so Orders can be processed 3X faster compared to the market leader.

On top of that we’ve built FluentCart for complete programmatic control. REST API endpoints are available for all key resources. Due to this the frontend can be completely decoupled with technology like Vue and Alpine.

Whether you're building custom apps on top of FluentCart or creating complex checkout flows, this plugin is built to stay out of your way and give you the keys.

== Customization and Design ==
No more fighting layouts. Style your cart, checkout, and product pages exactly how you want using your theme, no forced stylesheets or layout overrides. 

Customize every part of the experience: product card components, variation pickers, quantity selectors, checkout forms, and thank-you pages. All templates are overrideable. Whether you’re designing high-converting sales funnels or frictionless repeat purchase flows, FluentCart is built for modern storefront aesthetics.

You can set store branding with global customizations as soon as you setup FluentCart. The responsive blocks act as standard Gutenberg blocks so your store doesn’t break under any circumstances, even on mobile. Moreover, you get direct compatibility with popular store themes along with page builders like Elementor and Bricks Builder. 

If you need even more customizability, the option to use advanced CSS is also available to give you complete design control. 

= Blocks =
* Product Grid
* Search Bar
* Customer Dashboard
* Check out
* Product Cards
* Product Gallery
* Product Info

== Business Growth ==
FluentCart includes tools that help you operate at scale. From revenue analysis to team coordination, it comes with every operational tool pre-integrated, so you don’t need workarounds or extra plugins to manage growth. 

= Reports =
You get detailed breakdowns of subscriptions, refunds, and subscriber churn rates. Filter performance by product, category, date range, to evaluate the ROI of every sale.

= Payments =
Payments are at the heart of eCommerce. FluentCart handles automatic retry logic on failed subscription renewals, supports prorated charges for mid-cycle upgrades or plan changes, and lets you offer installment payments—all without custom coding or third-party checkout tools. You can switch gateways, track payment history, and automate invoicing with ease.

= Access Control =
User Role management means you can safely scale your internal team too. Grant access to team members based on function. Everything is role-based, compartmentalized, and securely accessible from the backend.

Every feature is tightly integrated, so your operational data flows through one system. No external dashboards. No syncing delays. Just live, accurate, and usable insight to help you grow smarter.

== Reinventing eCommerce ==
Building stores on WordPress has been riddled with slow queries, bloated schemas, bloated add-ons, and unscalable databases that make your store feel sluggish as it grows. SaaS platforms offload those problems by locking you into hosted environments, but charge you platform fees, gateway markups, and provide exactly zero control over your backend.

At its core, FluentCart runs on a custom database schema purpose-built for digital and subscription commerce. No legacy baggage. It uses fast, indexed tables that prioritize the read/write operations that matter most for modern stores such as, orders, customers, products, subscriptions, licenses, and transactions. This keeps your store snappy even under load, without relying on caching hacks or third-party optimizers. All data is structured for scalability. 

Whether you’re haqndling 50 or 50,000 orders, FluentCart maintains consistent performance with predictable query logic. No degrading response times as tables balloon, no complex migration paths when scaling up, and no reliance on external APIs to run day-to-day operations. 

And while most platforms make you pay for scale, whether through add-on upsells, platform commissions, or percentage-based transaction fees, FluentCart is truly self-hosted and pro-ownership. You pay once. You own it. There are zero transaction fees, no enforced usage tiers, and no hidden charges from payment providers. You can integrate Stripe, PayPal, local gateways, or your own custom processor using native hooks without ever sharing a cut.

== Data Privacy ==
Your data stays where it belongs, on your server. FluentCart does not phone home, track your customers, share checkout data or payment details. There's no reliance on cookies or third-party scripts for core functionality. 

For businesses under strict data policies or privacy regulations, like GDPR and EU DPA, FluentCart is the safest possible eCommerce option. You keep complete control of your stores data. Period.

== Integrations ==

* FluentCRM: Run marketing automations triggered by store actions and segment customers with lists and tags.

== Support ==
For us, support isn’t outsourced or run by third parties. You get direct access to the same expert team that builds and maintains the plugin, engineers who understand the codebase inside and out, and who treat your issue like it’s their own store.

We prioritize developer-level responsiveness and clarity in support tickets. That means no endless loops of canned replies, no asking for “more details” five times, and no dodging responsibility with vague documentation references. 

Whether you’re debugging a gateway integration or extending a checkout flow with hooks, our team is here to assist with clear, actionable guidance. But support doesn’t stop at tickets.

You also get access to a 10,000+ member strong community of Fluent product users across our ecosystem including store owners, developers, marketers, and SaaS builders who use FluentCRM, Fluent Support, FluentBooking, and now FluentCart. 

It's a collaborative environment where people share real-world workflows, custom code snippets, integration tips, and even performance benchmarks.
